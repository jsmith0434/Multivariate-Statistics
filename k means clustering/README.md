## K Means Clustering

### Intro
This project derives two versions of the K means algorithm for clustering data using numpy. The first method picks the initial starting points for the centroids randomly, while the second uses a maximum distance approach. Clustering is repeated until convergence using both methods. Loss is plotted at each k value from 2 to 10 as well as the final clusters assignments at k = 10.
